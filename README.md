## 🎯 About the Contest

The **ICPC Sharif Selection Contest** is one of the most significant events in the programming world, preparing top students and programmers each year to compete in the ICPC World Finals. The contest is divided into two main sections:

### 🔹 Part 1: Programming Fundamentals (Questions A to E)
This section focuses mainly on fundamental programming concepts, allowing you to test your abilities in solving basic problems and designing simple algorithms. Key topics include:
- Loops, conditionals, and control structures
- Using arrays and functions
- Basic algorithms like sorting

### 🔸 Part 2: Algorithm Design (Questions F to J)
The competition intensifies in this section, challenging you to find optimal solutions for more complex problems. These questions cover topics such as:
- Graph algorithms and search techniques (BFS, DFS)
- Combinatorial and geometric problems
- Optimization using advanced algorithms like dynamic programming and divide and conquer

🌟 **Personal Experience**

Ultimately, this contest was an incredible opportunity for both personal and professional growth. These experiences taught me that in the world of programming, every day presents a new challenge, and every moment is an opportunity to learn. Although I wasn't able to make it to the final round at Sharif University in Tehran and become the first team from my university last year, it was still a great memory, and I learned so much. This year (December 2024), I am proud to have become the top team at my university and achieved my goal. 😁👍
